### What is this GitHub repository about?
This repository is part of a STAT 545 Mini Data Analysis project, in which 4 out of 7 datasets is briefly looked at, and 1 is chosen for further analysis. The dataset chosen is “steam_games”, and after a series of exercise analysis, we listed down 4 research questions for further investigation.
### What files are under this repository?
In this repository, there is a README file, and an Rmd and MD file containing the Mini Data Analysis. 
### How do you run the code?
To start, the Rmd file can be downloaded and opened in Rstudio, or copy and pasted directly to your IDE. Please remember to load the library packages “datateachr” and “tidyverse” before running any of the code chunks. It is also best to run the code chunks sequentially as some of the later Exercise Questions relies on the previous exercises to input values that will be used.
